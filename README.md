# InflationForecast
I built a regression model and ARIMA model that predicts inflation rates using data on the exchange rate of the US Dollar, Brent Crude Oil Price, M2 Money Supply,Average Credit Interest Rate and total loan volume. I made inflation forecasts based on several assumptions.


If we look average for all assumptions, it is observed that the inflation rate at the end of 2023 will be %54.Maximum prediction is % 62 and minimum is %45
