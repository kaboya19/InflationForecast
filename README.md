# InflationForecast
I built a regression model and ARIMA model that predicts inflation rates using data on the exchange rate of the US Dollar, Brent Crude Oil Price, M3 Money Supply,Average Credit Interest Rate and Monthly Credit Growth. I made inflation forecasts based on two assumptions:
Assumption 1: I assume that there will be no significant tightening in the current levels of M3 Money Supply and Credit Growth, and they will continue to increase.
Assumption 2: I assume that monthly M3 Money Supply will not increase by more than 2%, and credits will decrease between 0.4% and 1% monthly.
Below are the inflation forecasts corresponding to these two assumptions.

I also added the code file of the 2nd assumption as InflationForecastAssumptionTwo.ipynb. Please check it.

In both assumptions, it is observed that the inflation rate at the end of 2023 will be above 65%.
